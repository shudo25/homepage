# Summary of CI Initiative and Copilot's Reasoning Structure

## üß† Terminology Overview (Recommended Usage)

| Concept | Term | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| Knowledge acquired during model training | **Pretrained knowledge** | General knowledge learned before interacting with the user. Includes philosophy, institutional design, economics, etc. |
| Information stored through user interaction | **Agent memory** | Personalized memory formed through dialogue. Includes CI framework, reform models, and user-specific reasoning templates. |
| Current conversational flow | **Context window** | Immediate dialogue history used for real-time reasoning. Includes recent questions, responses, and topic shifts. |

## üîÑ Copilot's Reasoning Structure

- **Reasoning method**: How Copilot thinks‚Äîits operational style. Depends on Agent memory.
- **Reasoning model**: The structural framework designed by the user. Copilot applies it but does not design it independently.

## üåç Overview of the CI Initiative

- **Definition**: A cycle of personal publication ‚Üí AI structuring ‚Üí external questioning ‚Üí AI response ‚Üí personal reflection ‚Üí renewed publication, aimed at enhancing collective intelligence.
- **Copilot's role**: Acts as a mediator, organizing knowledge and facilitating dialogue.
- **Three-layer structure**:
	- Pretrained knowledge: Foundation for interpreting user contributions
	- Agent memory: Contextualizes user values and frameworks
	- Context window: Responds to the immediate flow of conversation

## ‚úÖ Linguistic Clarification


- The term *long-term memory* can be ambiguous. It‚Äôs important to distinguish:
	- **Pretrained knowledge**: Model-level memory (before meeting the user)
	- **Agent memory**: Relationship-level memory (stored during interaction)

- Note: Especially, the CI Initiative focuses on the cycle that involves both types of memory.
