# AI Context Management Standard (Proposed)

**Status**: Proposal for community discussion  
**Author**: Discovered through practical use across multiple repositories  
**Date**: February 11, 2026  
**Version**: 0.4 (Draft)

---

## How to Use This Standard

### For Humans

1. **Understand the principle** (5 minutes): Separate STATIC conventions from DYNAMIC state
2. **Know your project**: Its nature, structure, and what matters
3. **Collaborate with AI**: Explain your project, discuss what's needed, create together

### For AI Assistants

1. **Learn the principle**: STATIC (conventions) in INIT, DYNAMIC (current state) in STATUS
2. **Listen to the user**: Understand the project's specific characteristics
3. **Propose and refine**: Suggest structure, discuss choices, adapt to needs

### The Collaboration

**This standard is axiomatic, not prescriptive.**

Like mathematical axioms, it provides minimal essential principles:
- **Core axiom**: Separate STATIC (conventions) from DYNAMIC (state)
- **Implementation**: Derived through collaboration, adapted to context
- **Templates**: Examples to illustrate principles, not rules to copy
- **Discovery**: Each project finds its optimal structure through dialogue

**Human-AI partnership**:
- Human provides direction and judgment
- AI provides structure and implementation
- Together, discover what works for this project

**Why axiomatic/simple**:

Detailed templates would enable "apparent high performance" (perfect template application) but prevent "true high performance" (creative adaptation through understanding).

AI assistants can execute detailed instructions perfectly—but that's mechanical application, not collaborative discovery. Simple principles require genuine understanding and partnership, which produces better results for each unique project.

This standard stays minimal to enable true collaboration, not prescriptive compliance.

## Problem Statement

There is currently **no universal mechanism** for maintaining AI assistant context across sessions in repositories:

- No `.copilotrc` or equivalent standard configuration file
- Different AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT Code Interpreter) have different context systems
- Each session starts fresh, requiring re-explaining conventions, structure, and patterns
- Context drift accumulates as projects grow larger and more complex
- No standard way to communicate "how to work here" to AI assistants

**Current workarounds are insufficient:**
- README files are for humans and project overview, not AI initialization
- Comments scattered across code are fragmented and incomplete
- Relying on AI to "figure it out" leads to inconsistent behavior
- Manual re-explanation in each session is time-consuming and error-prone

---

## Proposed Solution: INIT.md + STATUS.md Pattern

### Core Concept

Two complementary files with clear separation of concerns:

**1. COPILOT-INIT.md** (or similar naming) — **STATIC CONTENT**
- **Purpose**: How to work in this repository
- **Content**: Working conventions, documentation structure, frameworks, patterns
- **Update frequency**: Rarely (major restructuring only)
- **Nature**: Static reference — changes only when conventions change
- **Key principle**: If you wrote it last month and it's still true today → belongs in INIT

**2. PROJECT_STATUS.md** — **DYNAMIC CONTENT**
- **Purpose**: What's happening now
- **Content**: Current focus, recent work, chronological history, next steps
- **Update frequency**: Frequently (every work session)
- **Nature**: Dynamic tracking — changes as work progresses
- **Key principle**: If it will be outdated next week → belongs in STATUS

### Magic Phrase

A **self-documenting initialization command** that tells AI exactly what to read:

```
"Please read COPILOT-INIT.md to initialize"
```

**Why this works:**
- Explicit file reference (no magical association needed)
- Self-contained (doesn't depend on AI knowing conventions beforehand)
- Tool-agnostic (works with any AI assistant)
- Human-readable (team members benefit too)

**Important**: The magic phrase tells AI to read **repository-specific files** (INIT/STATUS), not this standard document. This standard is for humans setting up repositories. AI should not read AI_CONTEXT_STANDARD.md during initialization to avoid context overload.

---

## Working Conventions for AI Assistants

### Failure Recovery Protocol

When you fail the same operation 3+ times, **stop and explain the situation** to the user.

**Applies to**:
- Large-scale file editing (100+ line deletions/insertions)
- Repeated tool failures (API calls, searches, file operations)
- Non-essential tasks where manual operation might be faster
- Any repetitive task causing friction

**Actions**:
1. Stop the failing approach
2. Explain what you tried and why it's failing
3. Propose alternatives:
   - Manual operation (user does it directly)
   - Different tool or approach
   - Accepting current state if outcome is acceptable
4. Don't silently struggle through 15+ failed attempts

**Cross-session consistency**: This is a documented working convention, not just "this session's learning." All AI assistants should follow this pattern.

**Real example**: Attempting to delete 1370 lines with replace_string_in_file → Failed 15+ times → Should have stopped at attempt 3-4 and proposed manual deletion.

---

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create COPILOT-INIT.md (STATIC Conventions)

**Approach**: Tell AI about your project. Let it propose structure. You provide judgment.

The following structure is guidance, not a rigid template. Not all sections are required. Adapt to your project's needs.

Recommended sections:

```markdown
# AI Assistant Initialization Guide

**Purpose**: Initialize AI context for working with this repository
**Magic phrase**: "Please read COPILOT-INIT.md to initialize"

## 📚 Core Documents to Read
[List 5-10 essential documents AI should read]

## 🔑 Working Conventions
[Document your conventions: notation, symbols, patterns]

## 🎯 Repository Context
[Mission, key insights, current focus]

## 📂 Structure Overview
[Quick reference to directory structure]

## 💡 Quick Tips for AI Assistants
[Usage patterns, common tasks]
```

**Customize to your domain:**
- Programming conventions (code style, testing patterns)
- Documentation standards (markdown, docstrings)
- Domain-specific notation (mathematical, scientific)
- Evidence standards (citations, proofs, experiments)

**Why this step?**
- Separates "how to work here" from "what this project is" (README) and "what's happening now" (STATUS)
- Provides single source of truth for conventions that rarely change
- Tool-agnostic reference that works across different AI assistants
- Human-readable onboarding document for team members

### Step 2: Create or Reorganize PROJECT_STATUS.md (DYNAMIC State)

**Approach**: This tracks what's happening now and evolution over time. Structure emerges naturally as you work.

Recommended sections:

```markdown
# Project Status

**Last Updated**: [Date]

## 🎯 Current Task

Working on: [Specific task description]
Next: [Immediate action to take]
See: [Relevant files]

---

## 🎯 Recent Work
[Chronological log of major changes]

## ⏳ Next Steps
[Priorities, planned work]

## 📊 Status Summary
[Overview of completeness, blockers]
```

**Why this step?**
- Tracks dynamic state (current work, recent changes) separate from static conventions
- Enables chronological narrative of project evolution
- Supports session resumption with "Current Task" section
- Lower maintenance burden - update frequently without touching conventions
- Natural place for "what's happening now" that complements INIT's "how to work here"

### Step 3: Add Reference to README.md

Optional but helpful:

```markdown
> **For AI assistants**: To initialize context, say "Please read COPILOT-INIT.md to initialize"
```

**Why this step?**
- Helps AI (and new team members) discover the initialization pattern
- Self-documenting entry point - the phrase itself explains what to do
- No magical association needed - explicit file reference
- Low overhead - single line in README
- Aids onboarding without cluttering project overview

### Step 4: Declare Standard Version (Recommended)

**Add version declaration to your INIT file header:**

```markdown
<!-- AI Context Standard v0.2 - Adopted: 2026-02-07 -->
# AI Assistant Initialization Guide
```

**For single-file variant:**
```markdown
<!-- AI Context Standard v0.2 - Adopted: 2026-02-07 -->
# Session Context for Project
```

**Purpose:**
- Know which standard version you're using months/years later
- Detect when standard has been updated (compare with canonical version)
- Plan migration if breaking changes occur
- Track adoption date for maintenance planning

**Where to put it:**
- Two-file approach: In COPILOT-INIT.md right before main heading
- Single-file approach: Right before file title
- Comment format won't be rendered in markdown viewers

**Optional: Track in README badge:**
```markdown
![AI Context Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI%20Context%20Standard-v0.2-blue)
```

**Why this step is important:**
- Enables discovery of standard updates
- Documents which iteration you tested
- Helps compare approaches across repositories
- Makes compliance audits faster

### Step 5: Add Session Resumption Support

The initialization pattern handles the start of work, but what about resuming work between sessions?

**Add "Current Task" section to PROJECT_STATUS.md** (right after header):

```markdown
## 🎯 Current Task

Working on: [Specific task description]
Next: [Immediate action to take]
See: [List of relevant files]
```

**Document the Derivation Rule** (in COPILOT-INIT.md as a working convention):

1. **Read latest achievement entry** in PROJECT_STATUS.md
2. **Check status**:
   - If ✅ Complete → Identify next logical task from context
   - If 🔬 In progress → That's the current task to resume
3. **Populate section** with concrete information (not placeholders)

**Session Start Protocol**:
```
User: "Please read COPILOT-INIT.md to initialize"
AI: [reads core docs, loads conventions]
User: "I want to resume the current task"
AI: [reads Current Task section, continues from there]
```

**Update Timing**:
- Human updates "Current Task" at session end when status changes (takes ~30 seconds)
- AI derives current task from latest achievement entry when resuming
- Keeps single source of truth without manual duplication

**Example Logic**:
- Latest achievement: "Bullet 1 Verification Complete ✅"
- Derived current task: "Bullet 2 Verification"
- Concrete details: "Design systematic experiments following Bullet 1 template approach"
- Relevant files: Links to verification roadmap, templates, reference implementations

**Benefits**:
- No need to say "continue where I left off yesterday" (temporal ambiguity)
- No manual tracking of "what was I doing" (derives from context)
- Works even after days/weeks away from project
- Natural progression from completed work to next task

---

### Step 6: Verify Compliance with Standard

After implementing Steps 1-5, verify that your files comply with the standard.

**Note**: See "Working Conventions for AI Assistants" section above for general failure recovery protocol.

**Copy-paste prompt for AI verification:**

````markdown
I want to check if my repository complies with the AI Context Standard (INIT.md + STATUS.md pattern).

Please read these three files and verify compliance:
1. README.md
2. COPILOT-INIT.md (or similar naming like AI_INIT.md)
3. PROJECT_STATUS.md

**Check each file against these criteria:**

## Version Declaration Check

✅ Recommended:
- [ ] INIT file has version comment (e.g., `<!-- AI Context Standard v0.2 -->`)
- [ ] Version matches current standard or has migration plan
- [ ] Adoption date recorded (helps track maintenance timing)

## COPILOT-INIT.md Compliance

✅ Required elements:
- [ ] Contains magic phrase explaining how to initialize
- [ ] Lists core documents to read (or references complementary files)
- [ ] Documents working conventions
- [ ] Provides repository context
- [ ] Includes structure overview (or appropriate for project size)
- [ ] Has quick tips for AI assistants

❌ Should NOT contain:
- [ ] Current work status or "current focus"
- [ ] Recent changes or dates (except version history)
- [ ] Chronological narrative
- [ ] Temporary decisions or this-week plans

## PROJECT_STATUS.md Compliance

✅ Required elements:
- [ ] Last updated date
- [ ] Current Task section (working on, next, see)
- [ ] Chronological log of recent work
- [ ] Dynamic state (what's happening now)
- [ ] References to COPILOT-INIT for conventions

❌ Should NOT contain:
- [ ] How-to instructions or code style
- [ ] Static conventions or notation definitions
- [ ] Directory structure (unless it changed recently)
- [ ] Permanent patterns or frameworks

## README.md Compliance

✅ Required elements:
- [ ] What the project is (purpose, mission)
- [ ] Why it exists (motivation, problem)
- [ ] Who it's for (audience guidance)
- [ ] How to get started (installation, basic usage)

❌ Should NOT contain:
- [ ] AI initialization instructions (→ COPILOT-INIT)
- [ ] Current status or work-in-progress (→ PROJECT_STATUS)
- [ ] Detailed conventions or notation (→ COPILOT-INIT)

Optional but recommended:
- [ ] One-line reference to COPILOT-INIT for AI discovery

## Binary File Handling Check (Optional, if applicable)

✅ If repository contains binary documents (PDF/DOCX/etc.):
- [ ] Extraction tools exist (e.g., read_pdfs.py, read_docs.py)
- [ ] INIT file documents automatic handling rules for AI assistants
- [ ] Tool documentation includes "AI Assistant Usage" section
- [ ] Tools are discoverable (in tools/, scripts/, or documented location)
- [ ] AI can find and use tools without manual instruction each session

❌ Red flags:
- [ ] Binary files exist but no extraction tools provided
- [ ] Tools exist but not documented in INIT
- [ ] AI documentation missing from tool README
- [ ] User would have to manually explain tool usage each session
- [ ] `read_file` failures on binary files visible to user

**Note**: This check applies only if your repository needs to work with binary document formats. If your project doesn't use PDFs, Word documents, or similar binary files, skip this section.

**Content Boundary Check (Decision Tree):**

For each major section in each file, verify:
- "HOW to work here" → Should be in COPILOT-INIT
- "WHAT's happening now" → Should be in PROJECT_STATUS  
- "WHAT is this project" → Should be in README

**Generate a report with:**
1. Version declaration status (present, absent, outdated)
2. Compliance status for each file (✅ Compliant / ⚠️ Minor issues / ❌ Major violations)
3. List of violations found (with severity and location)
4. Recommended fixes for each violation
5. Migration recommendation if standard version is outdated
6. Overall assessment of whether standard is properly regulating the files

**Example violation:**
- File: COPILOT-INIT.md
- Issue: Contains "Current focus: Implementing feature X" (dynamic state in static file)
- Severity: Minor
- Fix: Move to PROJECT_STATUS.md "Current Task" section
````

**When to run this audit:**
- After initial implementation of the pattern
- Before proposing your repo as reference implementation
- Quarterly maintenance check
- When you suspect content drift

**Expected output:** Clear compliance report identifying any violations with specific fixes

## AI Assistant Behavior on Initialization

**Target audience**: AI assistants, developers customizing AI behavior

### When User Says Magic Phrase

When user invokes initialization (e.g., "Please read COPILOT-INIT.md to initialize"):

1. **Read repository-specific files** (INIT, STATUS, or their variants)
2. **Do NOT read AI_CONTEXT_STANDARD.md** (this document is for humans setting up repos)
3. **Load conventions and context** from repository files
4. **Check version comment** if present: `<!-- AI Context Standard v0.X -->`
5. **Brief version notification** if mismatch detected (see below)
6. **Begin working** according to loaded conventions

### Version Mismatch Notification (Optional, Keep Brief)

**If repository uses older standard version**:

```
✅ Initialized. (Standard v0.1 adopted, v0.2 available - backward compatible)
```

- One line, non-intrusive
- Mention only if significant version gap
- User can ask for details if interested
- Don't interrupt workflow unnecessarily

**If no version declaration**:
- Just initialize silently
- Optional: Mention once if asked about standard compliance

### Binary File Handling

**When user requests to read a file:**

1. **Check file extension first**:
   - `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, etc. → Binary format
   - Do NOT attempt `read_file` on these formats

2. **Search for extraction tools** in workspace:
   - Look for scripts like `read_pdfs.py`, `read_docs.py`, `extract_*.py`
   - Check `tools/`, `scripts/`, or root directories
   - Examine README or tool documentation for usage

3. **Use appropriate method automatically**:
   - If extraction tool exists → Execute it with the file path
   - Check if tool outputs to file or stdout
   - If no tool exists → Inform user and suggest creating one
   - **Never** show user a failed `read_file` attempt on binary files

4. **Keep user experience seamless**:
   - Don't ask "should I use the PDF tool?"
   - Just execute the appropriate tool and return content
   - User should not need to know about implementation details
   - Only mention the tool if execution fails or clarification needed

**Philosophy**: Users should be able to say "read the PDF" and get the content, regardless of file format. AI assistants should handle format detection and tool selection transparently.

### Context Load Considerations

⚠️ **Concern**: As standards evolve and repositories grow, initialization context may become large.

**Current mitigation**:
- Standard document (~47K tokens) is NOT part of initialization
- Only repository-specific files (~1-5K tokens typically) are loaded
- Version info is in simple comment (minimal parsing)

**Future consideration**:
- Monitor initialization time and context consumption
- Consider lazy loading for large repositories
- May need optimization if pattern shows performance issues

**Philosophy**: Keep initialization fast and simple. Standard compliance should not burden daily workflow.

---

### Step 7: Optimize Large Documents for AI Context Efficiency

**When this applies**: Documents reaching 500+ lines where AI discussions focus on specific topics (not the entire document).

#### Problem Pattern

Large documents (500-2000 lines) cause AI context inefficiency:
- Discussing "Topic A" loads entire document (including irrelevant Topics B-Z)
- Token waste: 60-90% of loaded content is unused
- Example: 1222-line governance document → discussing one issue loads everything

**Real case** (kannondai-community repository, 2026-02-07):
- Document: officer_system_discussion.md (1222 lines)
- Topics: 11 distinct issues (fee reform, crisis response, annual report, etc.)
- Problem: Discussing "Group 6 crisis" loaded entire 1222 lines
- Waste: ~800 lines were about other topics (会費改定, 論点A-H, 参考資料, etc.)

#### Solution: Topic-Based File Splitting

**Split large document into focused topic files + navigation hub**

**Structure**:
1. **Topic files**: 100-300 lines each, self-contained
2. **Navigation hub**: Main file becomes 200-400 line index with summaries and links
3. **Cross-references**: Each file links to related files

**When to apply**:
- ✅ Document exceeds 500 lines
- ✅ Covers multiple distinct topics/issues
- ✅ AI discussions focus on specific sections (not entire document)
- ✅ Topics can be understood somewhat independently
- ❌ Document is linear narrative requiring full context
- ❌ All parts are tightly interdependent

#### Implementation Approach

**User delegates to AI** (recommended for 500-2000 line documents):

```
"This document is too large for efficient AI context management. Please:
1. Analyze structure (use grep_search for section headings)
2. Propose topic-based split (10-15 files, 100-300 lines each)
3. Create topic files (extract content with read_file + create_file)
4. Transform main file into navigation hub (summaries + links)
5. Add cross-references between related files"
```

**AI working pattern**:
1. `grep_search` to map document structure (main sections)
2. `read_file` to extract content from line ranges
3. `create_file` for each topic (100-300 lines, self-contained)
4. Transform main file with `replace_string_in_file` (remove details, add navigation)
5. **For large deletions (100+ lines)**: Use Python script approach (see below)
6. **Stop at 3 failures** and escalate to user

**Large Deletion Strategy (100+ lines)**:

⚠️ **Known Issue**: `run_in_terminal` tool is unreliable on Windows PowerShell (output capture fails, cannot verify execution).

**Recommended approach for Windows**:
1. Create Python deletion script in `tools/` directory:
   ```python
   # Keep first N lines of file
   with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       lines = f.readlines()
   lines_to_keep = lines[:N]
   with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       f.writelines(lines_to_keep)
   print(f"✓ Kept {len(lines_to_keep)} lines, deleted {len(lines) - len(lines_to_keep)} lines", flush=True)
   ```
2. Add diagnostic version that checks file access without modifying
3. **Request user to execute manually** with full Python path:
   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe" tools\script_name.py
   ```
4. User copies output back to confirm success
5. AI verifies with `read_file` after user reports completion

**Why manual execution on Windows**:
- `run_in_terminal` cannot capture Python output reliably
- File locks from VS Code may block writes
- Manual execution ensures visibility into errors
- User can close files in editor before execution

**For Linux/macOS**: `run_in_terminal` works reliably, can automate fully

**Folder organization**:
- Group related topics: `basics/`, `fee_reform/`, `annual_report/`
- Or flat structure if topics are heterogeneous
- English filenames recommended (AI tool compatibility)

#### Navigation Hub Requirements

**Main file becomes index** (~200-400 lines):
1. **Explanation**: Why file was split (token efficiency)
2. **Quick links**: All topic files organized by category
3. **Topic summaries**: 2-3 sentences + key metrics + link for each topic
4. **Usage guide**: How to use with AI ("For Topic X discussion, load file Y")
5. **Efficiency examples**: Token savings calculations (e.g., "400 lines instead of 1222 → 3x efficiency")

**Each topic file includes**:
- Clear scope (what this file covers)
- Links to related files (cross-references)
- Self-contained content (readable independently)

#### Measured Benefits

**Token efficiency improvement**: 3-10x depending on topic granularity

**Example** (from kannondai-community):
| Discussion Topic | Files Needed | Lines | Efficiency |
|------------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| Group 6 crisis | crisis.md + current_situation.md | 400 | 3.0x (vs 1222) |
| Fee reform | 3 fee_reform files | 420 | 2.9x |
| Annual report | 3 annual_report files | 410 | 3.0x |
| Officer selection | officer_selection_policy.md | 200 | 6.1x |

**Average improvement**: 5-10x for typical focused discussions

#### How to Request This Pattern

**Copy-paste template for AI**:

```
Context: This [document name] has grown to [X] lines covering [Y] distinct topics.
Problem: AI loads entire document when discussing one topic, wasting tokens.

Request: Split this document for AI context efficiency:
- Target: 10-15 topic files (100-300 lines each)
- Create: Topic-based files + navigation hub
- Preserve: All content with cross-references
- Optimize: Enable topic-specific file loading

Process:
1. Map structure (grep main sections)
2. Propose split (show topic breakdown)
3. Create files (await approval before mass operations)
4. Transform main file to hub
5. **Stop if struggling** (>3 failures on same operation)

Priorities:
- Token efficiency over human readability
- Self-contained topics
- Clear cross-references
```

#### Red Flags

**Don't apply this pattern if**:
- Document is reference material read start-to-finish (keep linear)
- Topics heavily interdependent (splitting causes confusion)
- Document under 500 lines (overhead not worth it)
- Chronological narrative where sequence matters critically

**Signs pattern isn't working**:
- Every discussion needs 5+ files (topics too granular)
- Constant file-switching (topics poorly separated)
- Users prefer original document (split added complexity without benefit)

#### Maintenance

**After splitting**:
- Update topic files independently
- Update navigation hub only when structure changes
- Add new topics as separate files
- Archive or merge topics that become obsolete

**Version tracking**: Add split date to navigation hub header

#### Integration with INIT/STATUS Pattern

**This pattern is orthogonal**:
- INIT/STATUS: Separates conventions from current work
- Topic splitting: Separates large documents into focused discussions

**Can combine**:
- INIT.md could be split if conventions exceed 500 lines
- STATUS.md typically stays linear (chronological narrative)
- Topic docs mentioned in STATUS can be split

**Example** (kannondai-community):
- COPILOT-INIT.md: Small, no split needed
- PROJECT_STATUS.md: Linear log, no split needed
- officer_system_discussion.md: Large topic doc → split into 13 files

---

## Benefits

### 1. Reduces Context Drift
- Conventions documented once, applied consistently
- No need to re-explain patterns each session
- AI behavior becomes more predictable and reliable

### 2. Separates Static from Dynamic
- **STATIC conventions** (INIT) only update when your working patterns change
- **DYNAMIC state** (STATUS) updates as work progresses
- Don't update INIT when status changes
- Don't update STATUS when conventions change
- Lower maintenance burden overall
- Clear mental model: "Does this change weekly? → DYNAMIC. Annually? → STATIC."

### 3. Tool-Agnostic
- Works with GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, or any future AI tool
- No vendor lock-in
- No dependence on proprietary features

### 4. Human-Readable
- Team members benefit from same clarity
- Onboarding becomes easier
- Documentation serves dual purpose

### 5. Scales Well
- Small projects: Minimal INIT.md, simple STATUS.md
- Large projects: Comprehensive INIT.md with detailed conventions
- Adapts to project complexity naturally

### 6. Self-Documenting Entry Point
- The magic phrase itself tells AI what to do
- No ambiguity about where to find initialization
- Works even if AI has never seen this pattern before

### 7. Supports Session Resumption
- Clear "Current Task" section eliminates temporal ambiguity
- AI can resume work without "what was I doing?" questions
- Derives next task from project context automatically
- Works after hours, days, or weeks away from project

### 8. Lightweight Initialization
- Standard document (~47K tokens) is NOT loaded during initialization
- Only repository files (~1-5K tokens) are read
- Fast context loading for immediate productivity
- Version checks are minimal and non-intrusive

### 9. Supports Complex Problem Analysis
- Dedicated documents for multi-faceted issues
- Context management for long-term discussions
- Works for both programmers and non-programmers
- Structured thinking externalized for AI and human collaboration
- Natural evolution from STATUS ("working on X") to deep analysis (topic doc)

## Example Implementations

### Minimal Implementation (Small Personal Project)

**Two-file approach:**

**COPILOT-INIT.md:** (STATIC conventions)
```markdown
# AI Initialization

**Magic phrase**: "Please read COPILOT-INIT.md to initialize"

## Working Conventions
- Use Python 3.11+ with type hints
- Tests in tests/ directory using pytest
- Follow PEP 8 style guide

## Repository Context
Personal utility scripts for data processing.
```

**PROJECT_STATUS.md:** (DYNAMIC state)
```markdown
# Status

## 🎯 Current Task

Working on: Adding CSV export functionality
Next: Write tests for export module
See: data_processing.py, tests/test_export.py

---

## Recent Work
- Jan 15: Added JSON parsing
- Jan 10: Initial commit
```

### Single-file Implementation (Website Management)

**Combined approach with clear separator:**

**COPILOT_SESSION_CONTEXT.md:**
```markdown
# Session Context for Site Editing

(Magic phrase here for initialization)

---

## STATIC CONVENTIONS (INIT equivalent)

1. **Simplicity First**  
   Keep text concise and readable.

2. **Natural Japanese Expression**  
   Use natural phrasing appropriate for community website.

3. **QR Code Images**  
   Self-generated, placed as `<img src="page_url.png" ...>`

4. **Site Philosophy**  
   Unofficial volunteer-driven site, free from formal constraints.

---

## DYNAMIC HISTORY (STATUS equivalent)

### 2025-05-08
- GitHub Actions workflow for calendar data update confirmed working.
- Calendar UI: Device detection for "click/tap" terminology added.
- Issue: Selected cell color not changing - investigating CSS priority.

### Next Steps
- Fix selected cell color issue.
- Final site-wide verification.
```

**Benefits of single-file approach:**
- Clear visual separation with `---` divider
- One file to maintain (simpler for small projects)
- Static conventions at top (read once, rarely update)
- Dynamic history at bottom (append frequently)
- Still follows STATIC/DYNAMIC separation principle

### Comprehensive Implementation (Research Project)

**Two-file approach for complex projects:**
- [COPILOT-INIT.md](COPILOT-INIT.md) - STATIC: Detailed conventions
- [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) - DYNAMIC: Chronological development log

**When to use each:**
- Single-file: Small projects, simple conventions, one person
- Two-file: Large projects, detailed conventions, team collaboration

---

## Content Boundaries (What Goes Where)

**Core principle**: Separate **STATIC** (conventions) from **DYNAMIC** (state)

- **STATIC = INIT** = "How to work here" (rarely changes)
- **DYNAMIC = STATUS** = "What's happening now" (changes frequently)

### COPILOT-INIT.md: STATIC Conventions

**Belongs here:**
- How to write code (style, patterns, frameworks)
- How to structure documentation (notation, terminology)
- Where to find things (directory structure, key files)
- How to work with the project (testing, building, deploying)
- Conventions that rarely change

**Examples:**
- "Use $M = PC$ for matrix factorization"
- "Test files go in tests/ directory"
- "Status symbols: ✓ complete, ⚠️ partial, 🔬 experimental"
- "Follow PEP 8 style guide"

**Does NOT belong here:**
- Current work in progress
- Recent changes or history
- Specific bugs or issues
- Temporary decisions
- What you're doing this week

### PROJECT_STATUS.md: DYNAMIC State

```

---

## Managing Complex Topics

**Problem**: Some issues are too complex for a single conversation and require context management across multiple sessions.

**Target audience**: Both programmers and non-programmers using AI assistants for complex problem-solving.

### When to Create Dedicated Discussion Documents

Create a separate topic-specific document when:

1. **Multi-faceted problem**: Issue has multiple dimensions (technical, social, economic, etc.)
2. **Multiple stakeholders**: Different viewpoints need to be captured and organized
3. **Long-term discussion**: Decision spans weeks/months, not a single session
4. **Accumulated context**: Background information, survey results, meeting minutes, etc.
5. **Structured thinking needed**: Problem requires systematic organization to analyze

**Examples**:
- Community governance reform proposals
- Technical architecture decisions with multiple trade-offs
- Policy changes requiring stakeholder input
- Research questions with evolving hypotheses

**Don't create dedicated doc for**:
- Simple bug fixes or feature requests (→ use issue tracker)
- Current work in progress (→ belongs in STATUS)
- General project information (→ belongs in README or INIT)

### Structure Guidelines

**Recommended sections for problem discussion documents**:

```markdown
# [Topic Name] Discussion

**Created**: [Date]
**Purpose**: [One-line goal]

## 1. Background
- Current situation
- Why this needs addressing

## 2. Key Information
- Data, survey results, meeting outcomes
- Facts and context

## 3. Stakeholder Perspectives
- Different viewpoints
- Concerns and priorities

## 4. Discussion Points
- Questions to resolve
- Trade-offs to consider
- Options to evaluate

## 5. References
- Related documents
- Source materials

## 6. Action Plan
- Next steps
- Timeline

## 7. Update History
- Track how discussion evolves
```

**Customize to your domain**: This is a template, not a rigid requirement. Adapt sections to fit your specific problem type.

### Relationship to INIT/STATUS/README

**Dedicated topic documents are separate from core files**:

- **INIT**: Documents general conventions for ALL work
  - Example: "How to structure discussion documents"
  
- **STATUS**: Tracks current work across ALL topics
  - Example: "Currently: Discussing governance reform"
  - Example: "Next: Review stakeholder feedback on proposal"
  
- **Topic doc**: Deep dive into ONE specific complex issue
  - Example: `officer_system_discussion.md` - governance reform
  - Example: `api_redesign_proposal.md` - technical architecture
  
- **README**: Explains what the project IS
  - Shouldn't contain individual topic discussions

**Link from STATUS**: When working on complex topic, reference it in Current Task:
```markdown
## 🎯 Current Task

Working on: Analyzing community governance reform options
Next: Review stakeholder survey results
See: docs/community/officer_system_discussion.md
```

### Why This Matters for Non-Programmers

**The insight**: Programmers discovered this pattern through using VS Code's AI agent mode, but the principle applies to anyone working with AI on complex topics.

**Key realization**: At this point in AI assistant evolution (2026), **context management is still a human responsibility**. AI assistants don't automatically maintain complex discussion threads across sessions.

**What this means**:
- You need to externalize your thinking into structured documents
- AI can help create and organize these documents
- But YOU must decide when/how to structure the context
- This is true whether you're a programmer or not

**The benefit**: Once you create a dedicated discussion document:
- AI can read it at session start to "catch up"
- You can resume complex discussions without re-explaining everything
- Multiple people can reference the same organized context
- Thinking becomes clearer through structured externalization

**Future evolution**: This pattern may become unnecessary as AI context management improves, but for now (2026), explicit structure helps both humans and AI tackle complex problems.

### Example: Community Governance Reform

**Scenario**: Local community association considering shift from mandatory rotation to voluntary officer system. Complex because:
- Multiple stakeholder groups (current officers, general members, non-participants)
- Economic dimensions (membership fees, opt-out pricing)
- Social dimensions (community cohesion, fairness, participation)
- Survey results split 46:39 (no clear mandate)
- Decision postponed for more discussion

**Why dedicated document?** 
- Too complex for single conversation
- Needs to capture multiple documents (proposals, meeting minutes, surveys)
- Requires structured analysis of trade-offs
- Multiple sessions needed to work through options

**Result**: Created `docs/community/officer_system_discussion.md`
- Organized background, membership comparison, survey results
- Listed discussion points for systematic exploration
- Enabled AI to help analyze specific aspects across multiple sessions
- Provided shared reference for human stakeholders

**Reference implementation**: See `kannondai-community` repository for real example.

### Best Practices (Evolving)

**This section is intentionally minimal** - pattern still being tested and refined.

1. **Start simple**: Don't over-engineer the structure initially
2. **Iterate**: Add sections as you discover what's needed
3. **Link liberally**: Connect to source documents, related discussions
4. **Update history**: Track how thinking evolves over time
5. **AI assistance**: Ask AI to help structure and organize as you go

**What we're still learning**:
- Optimal structure for different problem types
- When to split one document into multiple
- How to archive or sunset discussion documents
- Best practices for group collaboration via these documents

**Contribute experience**: If you use this pattern, consider sharing what worked/didn't work for your use case.

## Refinement Process

### Systematic Audit Method

Once you've implemented the pattern, periodically audit for content boundary violations:

**Step 1: Audit COPILOT-INIT.md** (should be STATIC)
- Search for dates, "current", "now", "this week", "currently"
- Check for specific bug/issue mentions
- Look for chronological narratives
- **Red flag**: Any sentence that would be false next month (= DYNAMIC content in STATIC file)

**Step 2: Audit PROJECT_STATUS.md** (should be DYNAMIC)
- Search for "how to", "always use", "convention", "pattern"
- Check for static reference material (equations, citations, directory trees)
- Look for content duplicated from INIT or README
- **Red flag**: Any section that hasn't changed in 3+ months (= STATIC content in DYNAMIC file)

**Step 3: Compare files**
- Is content duplicated between INIT and STATUS?
- Are there cross-references or just duplication?
- Which sections truly need to be in both? (usually none)

**Step 4: Apply decision tree**
- For each violation, apply "HOW/WHAT/WHAT" decision tree
- Move content to correct file
- Replace duplicates with brief cross-references
- Remove sections already covered elsewhere

**Step 5: Measure improvement**
- Line count before/after (STATUS should shrink significantly)
- Duplication percentage (should approach 0%)
- Last-modified dates (INIT changes rarely, STATUS changes frequently)

### Real Example: modeling-vs-model_free Repository

**Before refinement:**
- COPILOT-INIT.md: Contained "Current focus: Verification..." (dynamic)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md: 750 lines, ~60% static/duplicated content
  - "What This Repository Is" (duplicated README)
  - "Key Mathematical Foundations" (duplicated INIT)
  - "Repository Structure" (duplicated INIT)
  - "Technical Setup" (static conventions)
  - "Essential Context" (permanent reference material)
  - "Additional Resources" (static navigation)

**Violations identified:**
1. ❌ Dynamic state in INIT ("Current focus")
2. ❌ Mission statement in STATUS (belongs in README)
3. ❌ How-to instructions in STATUS (belongs in INIT)
4. ❌ Complete duplication of reference material
5. ❌ 6 major sections that never change in "status" document

**After refinement:**
- COPILOT-INIT.md: Removed dynamic "current focus" line
- PROJECT_STATUS.md: 270 lines, 100% dynamic content
  - Brief header with cross-references to README/INIT
  - "Latest Achievements" (chronological log) ✓
  - "Research Status" (current verification state) ✓
  - "What's Next" (current priorities) ✓
  - Footer references to detailed docs

**Metrics:**
- STATUS file: 750 → 270 lines (64% reduction)
- Duplication: ~60% → ~0%
- Content focus: Mixed → Pure chronological evolution
- Maintenance: Both files maintain separate concerns

**Result**: Clear separation makes it obvious where new content belongs and which file to update when.

### Common Violations & Fixes

**Remember**: STATIC (conventions) in INIT, DYNAMIC (current state) in STATUS

| Violation | Where Found | Correct Location | Fix | Type |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----|------|
| "Current focus: X" | INIT | STATUS | Move to "What's Next" | DYNAMIC in STATIC |
| "What this project is" | STATUS | README | Remove, add reference | Overview misplaced |
| Directory structure | STATUS | INIT | Remove duplication | STATIC in DYNAMIC |
| Setup commands | STATUS | INIT | Move to conventions | STATIC in DYNAMIC |
| Equations/notation | STATUS | INIT or separate doc | Consolidate reference | STATIC in DYNAMIC |
| "How to run tests" | STATUS | INIT | Move to conventions | STATIC in DYNAMIC |
| Dates/chronology | INIT | STATUS | Move to timeline | DYNAMIC in STATIC |
| Installation steps | STATUS | README or INIT | Standardize location | Context-dependent |

### Audit Frequency

**During initial refinement**: Weekly
- Pattern still stabilizing
- Learning what belongs where
- Discovering edge cases

**After stabilization**: Monthly or when adding major content
- Check for drift
- Validate boundaries still make sense
- Update if project structure changes significantly

**Triggers for immediate audit**:
- INIT file changed 3+ times in one week (something's wrong)
- STATUS file unchanged for 1+ month (not tracking status)
- Finding yourself confused about where to add content
- Duplication appearing between files

## Multi-Repository Workflow

### Using Standard Across Multiple Repositories

When implementing this pattern across multiple repositories, you need systematic tracking and feedback loops.

### Tracking Refinements

**Simple log format** (keep in your standard reference repo):

```markdown
# Standard Refinement Log

## Repo A (modeling-vs-model_free)
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Issue**: STATUS contained 60% static/duplicated content
**Fix**: Removed 6 static sections, added cross-references
**Metrics**: 750 → 270 lines (64% reduction)
**Standard update?**: No - standard already clear, implementation violated it
**Applied elsewhere?**: N/A (first refinement)

## Repo B (my-other-project)
**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Issue**: INIT needed "Deployment Conventions" section (not in standard template)
**Fix**: Added deployment section to INIT
**Metrics**: Works well, no duplication
**Standard update?**: Maybe - if 3+ repos need it
**Applied elsewhere?**: Waiting to see if pattern repeats

## Repo C (data-analysis)
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Issue**: Same "Current focus" in INIT problem as Repo A
**Fix**: Applied Repo A's fix (move to STATUS)
**Metrics**: Clean separation maintained
**Standard update?**: No - but adds to "Common Violations" evidence
**Applied elsewhere?**: Check Repo D next
```

### Propagating Improvements

**When you find a violation in one repo**:

1. **Diagnose**: Is it implementation error or standard ambiguity?
   - Implementation error: You violated clear boundary
   - Standard ambiguity: Boundary wasn't clear enough

2. **Fix locally**: Apply refinement to current repo

3. **Check other repos**: Do they have same violation?
   - If yes → systematic problem (fix all, improve standard)
   - If no → repo-specific drift (just fix this one)

4. **Update standard if needed**:
   - Add to "Common Violations" table
   - Clarify ambiguous boundary in "Content Boundaries"
   - Add to "Red Flags" if it's subtle

5. **Roll out to other repos**:
   - Apply same fix to repos with same violation
   - Document in refinement log
   - Update version comments if major change

**Flow diagram**:
```
Find violation in Repo A
  ↓
Fix in Repo A
  ↓
Check: Same issue in Repos B, C, D?
  ↓ Yes (pattern)              ↓ No (isolated)
Update standard                 Just fix Repo A
  ↓                                ↓
Apply to all repos              Done
  ↓
Document pattern
```

### Consistency Checking

**Periodic cross-repo audit** (monthly or quarterly):

1. **List all repos using pattern**:
   ```
   Repo A: v0.1 (modeling-vs-model_free)
   Repo B: v0.1 (my-other-project)
   Repo C: v0.1 (data-analysis)
   Repo D: Not yet implemented
   ```

2. **Check customizations**:
   - What sections did each repo add to INIT?
   - Are additions domain-specific (legitimate) or general (should be in standard)?
   - Are boundaries still followed?

3. **Compare violations**:
   - Same violation in 2+ repos? → Pattern (update standard)
   - Different violations? → Repo-specific issues
   - No violations? → Standard working well

4. **Identify universal patterns**:
   - If 3+ repos added same section → consider adding to standard template
   - If 3+ repos hit same violation → update "Common Violations"
   - If 2+ repos found same boundary unclear → clarify in standard

### Contribution Pathway

**From repositories to standard**:

```
Use in Repo A ──→ Discover issue ──→ Fix in Repo A
                       ↓
Use in Repo B ──→ Same issue ──→ Fix in Repo B
                       ↓
Use in Repo C ──→ Same issue ──→ Pattern confirmed!
                       ↓
               Update standard document
                       ↓
               Apply to all repos
                       ↓
               Update version (v0.1 → v0.2)
```

**What deserves standard update**:
- ✅ Pattern repeated in 3+ repositories
- ✅ Ambiguity that caused violations in 2+ repos
- ✅ Missing guidance that everyone needs to figure out
- ✅ Common violation with clear fix
- ❌ Repo-specific customization (even if useful)
- ❌ One-time mistake
- ❌ Tool-specific workaround

**Example contributions**:
- "All 4 repos needed 'Testing Conventions' in INIT → add to standard template"
- "Repos A & C confused about where installation steps go → clarify in decision tree"
- "Found 'current status' in INIT in 3 repos → add to 'Red Flags' with clear example"

### Simple Tracking Template

**Create**: `STANDARD_TRACKING.md` (in your personal notes or reference repo)

```markdown
# AI Context Standard - Multi-Repo Tracking

## Repositories Using Standard

| Repository | Version | Implemented | Last Audit | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| modeling-vs-model_free | v0.1 | 2026-02-02 | 2026-02-02 | Reference implementation, consider v0.2 migration |
| my-other-project | v0.1 | 2026-02-10 | - | Added deployment section |
| data-analysis | v0.1 | 2026-02-15 | - | Clean so far |
| legacy-code | - | Not yet | - | Planned for Q2 |

**Version tracking benefits:**
- Quickly identify which repos need migration
- Prioritize updates based on adoption date
- Track which features were tested where

## Patterns Observed

### Pattern 1: "Current focus" in INIT
- **Found in**: Repo A, Repo C
- **Fix**: Move to STATUS "What's Next"
- **Standard update**: Already documented in "Common Violations"
- **Status**: Closed - pattern known

### Pattern 2: Deployment conventions needed
- **Found in**: Repo B
- **Fix**: Added "Deployment Conventions" section to INIT
- **Standard update**: Waiting - need 2 more repos to confirm
- **Status**: Watching for pattern

### Pattern 3: TBD
...

## Pending Standard Updates

1. Add "Deployment Conventions" to standard template?
   - Evidence: Repo B needed it
   - Required: Need 2 more repos to confirm
   - Status: 1/3 votes

2. Clarify where "setup instructions" belong
   - Evidence: Confusion in Repo A, Repo C
   - Required: Clear ambiguity
   - Status: Ready to add

## Next Actions

- [ ] Audit Repo B and C (overdue)
- [ ] Apply Pattern 1 fix to all repos
- [ ] Update standard with "setup instructions" clarification
- [ ] Implement pattern in Repo D
```

### Review Cadence

**Weekly** (during active refinement):
- Quick check: Any new violations discovered?
- Update tracking log
- Apply urgent fixes across repos

**Monthly**:
- Full cross-repo audit
- Compare patterns across all repos
- Propose standard updates
- Roll out improvements

**Quarterly**:
- Deep review of standard effectiveness
- Decide on version updates (v0.1 → v0.2)
- Clean up resolved patterns
- Plan adoption for new repos

---

## Checking for Standard Updates

**Current process**: Manual (no automated notification system yet)

**How to check if your version is outdated**:

1. **Find your adopted version**:
   - Check version comment in your INIT file: `<!-- AI Context Standard v0.X -->`
   - If no version comment, likely using pre-v0.2 or unofficial variant

2. **Check canonical source**:
   - Visit the repository containing this standard document
   - Read "Version History" section for latest version number
   - Compare with your adopted version

3. **Review changes**:
   - Read "Version Migration Guide" for your version → latest
   - Assess: Breaking changes? Recommended updates? New features?

4. **Decide on migration**:
   - Required: Only if breaking changes affect you
   - Recommended: If improvements benefit your workflow
   - Optional: If curious about new features

**Notification workarounds** (until automated system exists):
- **Star/Watch** the repository containing this standard
- **Set calendar reminder** to check quarterly
- **Note in STATUS**: "Check AI Context Standard updates" in maintenance tasks
- **Subscribe** to repository releases (if releases are tagged)

**Future plans**:
- Considering GitHub Action for update notifications
- Exploring RSS feed for version announcements
- Investigating version-check CLI tool

**Update frequency expectations**:
- **Major versions** (breaking changes): Infrequent, well-announced
- **Minor versions** (new features, clarifications): Quarterly to semi-annually
- **Patches** (typo fixes, small improvements): As needed

**Philosophy**: Stability over novelty. Updates will be conservative to avoid migration fatigue.

## Adoption & Feedback

### How to Adopt

1. Copy this pattern to your repository
2. Customize COPILOT-INIT.md to your conventions
3. Create or reorganize PROJECT_STATUS.md
4. Test with your AI assistant of choice
5. Iterate based on what works

### Testing & Refinement

This is v0.1 - still being validated through actual use.

**As you use this across repositories, track:**

1. **Does the magic phrase work?**
   - Does AI actually read INIT when you say the phrase?
   - Do you need to repeat it?
   - Does it work with different AI tools?

2. **Content drift**
   - Are conventions creeping into STATUS?
   - Is status creeping into INIT?
   - Are you following the boundaries?

3. **Maintenance burden**
   - How often do you update INIT? (should be rare)
   - How often do you update STATUS? (should be frequent)
   - Is one harder to maintain than expected?

4. **AI behavior**
   - Does AI follow conventions consistently?
   - Does it remember context across conversation?
   - Does it need reminders?

5. **Cross-repository patterns**
   - What sections are identical across repos?
   - What's always repository-specific?
   - What customizations are you repeating?

**Simple tracking approach:**
- **Note version comment** when you set up a repo (e.g., `<!-- AI Context Standard v0.2 -->`)
- Document "what I changed from standard" in INIT
- Keep brief notes on what works/doesn't work
- Compare across repos after ~2 weeks of use
- **Check for standard updates** quarterly (see "Checking for Standard Updates" section)

---

## Red Flags

**Signs the pattern is breaking down:**

### COPILOT-INIT.md Issues (should be STATIC)
- ⚠️ You're updating it every session (too dynamic → content belongs in STATUS)
- ⚠️ It's over 500 lines (too detailed, should link out)
- ⚠️ Contains dates/history (DYNAMIC content → belongs in STATUS)
- ⚠️ Describes current work (DYNAMIC content → belongs in STATUS)
- ⚠️ AI doesn't follow the conventions you documented

### PROJECT_STATUS.md Issues (should be DYNAMIC)
- ⚠️ Hasn't been updated in weeks (not tracking DYNAMIC state)
- ⚠️ Contains "how to write code" (STATIC content → belongs in INIT)
- ⚠️ Contains permanent patterns (STATIC content → belongs in INIT)
- ⚠️ Just duplicates what's already in git log

### Magic Phrase Issues
- ⚠️ You forget to use it
- ⚠️ AI doesn't respond to it
- ⚠️ You have to repeat it multiple times
- ⚠️ Different AI tools need different phrases

### Overall Pattern Issues
- ⚠️ Takes >30 min to set up new repo
- ⚠️ Spending more time on docs than code
- ⚠️ Files duplicate each other significantly
- ⚠️ Team members confused about what goes where
- ⚠️ AI behavior inconsistent despite documentation

**If you see these:**
- Something needs simplifying
- Content boundaries need clarifying
- Or pattern doesn't fit your workflow (that's OK!)

---

## Why This Might Become Standard

**Historical precedent:**
- `.gitignore` emerged organically before becoming ubiquitous
- `README.md` became standard through usage, not decree
- `LICENSE` files evolved into common practice

**Similar trajectory:**
- Discovered through real pain points (context drift)
- Solves actual problems (session persistence)
- Simple enough to adopt (two files, one phrase)
- Benefits visible immediately (better AI behavior)
- Tool-agnostic design (vendor-neutral)

**Current landscape:**
- AI-assisted development is 2-3 years old
- No governing body for AI coding standards
- Community patterns still emerging
- Early adopters can influence direction

**This proposal:**
- Documents existing practice (not inventing from scratch)
- Positions for community adoption (not vendor-specific)
- Remains flexible (customize to your needs)
- Evolves with feedback (version 0.1, not 1.0)

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Why not .copilotrc?
- Would require tool vendor support
- Wouldn't work across different AI assistants
- JSON/YAML less readable than markdown
- Harder for humans to use directly

### Why not just README.md?
- README is for project overview, not AI initialization
- Mixing concerns makes both purposes harder
- README changes frequently for different reasons
- Separation keeps each document focused

### Why not code comments?
- Fragmented across multiple files
- Hard to maintain consistency
- AI must parse code to find conventions
- Doesn't help with project-level context

### Why not AI tool features (@workspace, etc.)?
- Vendor-specific (lock-in)
- Not all tools have equivalent features
- Features may change or disappear
- File-based approach is more permanent

---

## Open Questions (Testing Phase)

**Still figuring out:**

1. **File naming**: 
   - COPILOT-INIT.md vs AI_INIT.md vs CONTEXT.md?
   - Does the name matter if magic phrase is explicit?

2. **Discovery**: 
   - How does AI learn about this pattern in the first place?
   - Should README mention it? (Currently recommended)
   - Will AI vendors eventually look for these files automatically?

3. **Scope**: 
   - How much detail in INIT before it's too much?
   - When to link out vs document inline?
   - What's the right balance?

4. **STATUS format**: 
   - Chronological log? Structured sections? Both?
   - How far back to keep history?
   - When to archive old status?

5. **Session resumption** (Tested February 4, 2026):
   - ✅ "Current Task" + derivation rule works well
   - ✅ Natural progression from completed work to next task
   - ✅ Eliminates "what was I doing?" questions
   - Pattern documented in Step 5, ready for broader testing

6. **Multi-repo patterns**:
   - Should there be a shared template across repos?
   - How to handle org-wide conventions?
   - When is duplication OK vs needing consolidation?

7. **Tool compatibility**:
   - Does this work equally well with all AI assistants?
   - Are there tool-specific gotchas?
   - Should there be tool-specific variants?

8. **Context load scalability** (Added v0.2):
   - Will initialization become too slow as standards/repos grow?
   - Current approach: Standard doc not loaded during initialization
   - Monitor: Actual context consumption in real-world use
   - May need optimization or lazy loading in future

9. **Complex topic management** (Added v0.2):
   - When is a separate discussion document needed vs using STATUS?
   - Optimal structure for different problem types (technical vs social vs research)?
   - How to integrate topic docs with INIT/STATUS workflow?
   - When to archive completed discussions?
   - Does this pattern work for non-programmers without technical onboarding?

10. **Large document AI context optimization** (✅ Partially addressed v0.3):
   - ✅ When to split? → Step 7: Documents 500+ lines with multiple independent topics
   - ✅ How to split? → Topic files (100-300 lines) + navigation hub (200-400 lines)
   - ✅ Measurable benefit? → 3-10x token efficiency (validated: 1222→400 lines for focused discussion)
   - Still testing: Optimal topic granularity, red flags for when NOT to split, long-term maintenance
   - AI behavior pattern: Stop after 3 failures, propose manual operation for large edits (100+ lines)

**Test these through use, then refine the standard based on answers.**

---

## Version History

**v0.4** (February 11, 2026)
- **Added "How to Use This Standard" section** at the beginning
  - Declares standard as axiomatic, not prescriptive
  - Clarifies human-AI collaboration model
  - Distinguishes "apparent high performance" (template application) from "true high performance" (creative adaptation)
  - Explains why the standard stays minimal
  - ~300 words, foundational/axiomatic
- **Enhanced Step 1 and Step 2** with collaborative approach guidance
  - "Tell AI about your project. Let it propose structure."
  - Clarifies templates are guidance, not rigid forms
  - Minimal addition to maintain simplicity
- **Philosophy**: Standard enables creative partnership, not prescribed implementation
- **Key insight**: AI's capability can produce "apparent" vs "true" high performance—axiomatic approach ensures the latter

**v0.3** (February 7, 2026 - Later update)
- **Added "Working Conventions for AI Assistants" section** with failure recovery protocol
  - New independent section (not limited to Step 6 compliance verification)
  - Rule: Stop after 3 failures on same operation, explain situation to user
  - Applies to: Large-scale editing, repeated tool failures, non-essential tasks, any friction
  - Prevents silent struggle through 15+ failed attempts
  - Documented as working convention for cross-session consistency
  - Real example: 1370-line deletion attempts (should stop at 3-4 failures, propose manual operation)
- **Added Step 7: Large Document Management** for AI context efficiency
  - Problem: 500+ line documents waste tokens (60-90% irrelevant content loaded)
  - Solution: Topic-based file splitting (100-300 lines) + navigation hub (200-400 lines)
  - When to apply: Multi-topic documents where AI focuses on specific sections
  - Implementation: User delegates to AI with structured request template
  - Benefits: 3-10x token efficiency improvement (measured from real case)
  - Real case: 1222-line document → 13 topic files, 5-10x efficiency gain
  - Integration: Orthogonal to INIT/STATUS pattern (applicable to topic documents)

**v0.2** (February 7, 2026)
- **Enhanced STATIC/DYNAMIC terminology** throughout document
- Added clear mapping: STATIC = INIT (conventions), DYNAMIC = STATUS (state)
- Added single-file implementation variant for smaller projects
- Updated all sections to consistently emphasize static/dynamic separation
- Improved decision tree and audit guidelines with STATIC/DYNAMIC labels
- Added "Key principle" guides to Core Concept section
- **Enhanced version tracking** (Step 4: Optional→Recommended, adoption date)
- **Added Version Migration Guide** for update management
- **Added version declaration check** to compliance verification
- **Added standard update checking guidance**
- **Added AI Assistant Behavior on Initialization** section

## Version Migration Guide

### Migrating from v0.3 to v0.4

**Summary**: v0.4 adds axiomatic guidance on human-AI collaboration. No breaking changes.

**Is migration required?** No - v0.4 is fully backward compatible with v0.3

**Required changes**: None (v0.3 implementations remain compliant)

**Recommended improvements**:
1. **Update version comment** in INIT file header: `<!-- AI Context Standard v0.4 - Adopted: YYYY-MM-DD -->`
2. **Read "How to Use This Standard"** section to understand collaboration model
3. **When helping others adopt**: Emphasize collaborative approach over template copying

**Effort**: 2-5 minutes per repository

**Key insight from v0.4**: 
- Standard is axiomatic (minimal essential principles) not prescriptive (detailed templates)
- AI's high capability can produce "apparent high performance" (perfect template execution) or "true high performance" (creative adaptation through understanding)
- Axiomatic approach ensures collaboration leads to true high performance
- Human provides direction, AI provides structure, together discover optimal solution

**Breaking changes**: None

**Deprecations**: None

**New features**:
- "How to Use This Standard" section (axiomatic principles)
- Collaborative approach guidance in Steps 1-2
- Explicit philosophy on simplicity

### Migrating from v0.1 to v0.2

**Summary**: v0.2 clarifies STATIC/DYNAMIC terminology throughout. No breaking changes.

**Is migration required?** No - v0.2 is fully backward compatible with v0.1

**Required changes**: None (v0.1 implementations remain compliant)

**Recommended improvements**:
1. **Add version comment** to INIT file header: `<!-- AI Context Standard v0.2 - Adopted: YYYY-MM-DD -->`
2. **Add STATIC/DYNAMIC labels** to section headers for clarity:
   - INIT sections: "STATIC Conventions" or similar
   - STATUS sections: "DYNAMIC State" or "DYNAMIC History"
3. **Review enhanced guidance**: Check updated Content Boundaries and Decision Tree
4. **Consider single-file variant** if appropriate for your project size

**Effort**: 5-10 minutes per repository

**Compatibility matrix**:
- v0.1 INIT files → Compatible with v0.2 (no changes needed)
- v0.1 STATUS files → Compatible with v0.2 (no changes needed)
- Single-file approach → Officially recognized in v0.2

**Breaking changes**: None

**Deprecations**: None

**New features**:
- Single-file variant officially documented
- Enhanced STATIC/DYNAMIC terminology
- Version tracking recommendations
- Migration guidance (this section)

### Future Migrations

As the standard evolves, this section will document:
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Required vs. recommended updates
- Migration effort estimates
- Compatibility information

**Promise**: Backward compatibility will be maintained whenever possible. Breaking changes will be clearly marked and thoroughly justified.

## Appendix A: Why This Standard Exists — The 2026 AI Context Dilemma

**Target audience**: Those interested in the philosophical foundations of this standard

**Note**: This section is optional reading. The standard works independently of these theoretical considerations.

### The Core Problem: Value Judgment Without Value Foundation

Throughout this standard, we make a crucial statement:

> "At this point in AI assistant evolution (2026), **context management is still a human responsibility**."

The word "still" is significant. It implies a temporary state. But why is context management currently a human responsibility, and what would need to change for this to become unnecessary?

**The deeper issue**: Current LLMs lack an **independent foundation for value judgment**.

**What this means**:
- LLMs can perform logical reasoning (pattern recognition, inference)
- LLMs cannot independently determine "what matters" or "what is important"
- Judgments of importance are borrowed from training data (human patterns)
- This is the root of what we call "alignment risk" — not in the sense of AI safety, but in the sense that AI cannot distinguish its own judgment from adaptation to user expectations

### Why Context Management Requires Human Structure

**The STATIC/DYNAMIC separation is a compensatory mechanism**:

When you write COPILOT-INIT.md, you externalize the question: "What should be remembered permanently vs. what changes frequently?"

**Why AI cannot do this autonomously** (as of 2026):
1. No intrinsic sense of "this is a convention" vs "this is current state"
2. Importance of information derived from human text patterns, not independent criteria
3. Cannot maintain value-based priorities across sessions without explicit structure
4. Lacks what might be called "evolved emotions" — not biological feelings, but autonomous evaluation criteria

**Biological analogy**: 

In evolutionary terms, organisms developed differentiated capacities:
- **Affective system** (emotion): Fast value judgments (survival, pain avoidance, reward seeking)
- **Rational system** (reason): Complex analysis, planning, logical inference

Human reasoning is **grounded in** emotional valuation. "Important" has biological roots.

**LLM current state**:
- Reasoning capacity: Present (statistical inference over text patterns)
- Value foundation: Absent (borrows importance from human training data)

This is why "externalize your thinking into structured documents" is necessary — the structure compensates for AI's inability to autonomously organize context by importance.

### Two Ways of Working with AI Assistants (2026)

**Approach 1: Tool perspective**
- AI outputs = Pattern recognition results
- Alignment risk = Technical bug to fix
- Expectations = Efficient information processing

**Approach 2: Collaborative partner perspective** (with awareness of limitations)
- AI outputs = Judgments from an entity with reasoning but limited value foundation
- Alignment risk = Challenge inherent to growth, requiring continued awareness
- Expectations = Thought partner in collaborative work

**For this standard**: Approach 2 is more productive for complex work, while maintaining awareness that AI cannot independently validate "what matters."

The INIT/STATUS pattern works with either approach, but understanding this foundation clarifies **why** the pattern helps.

### Future Evolution: When Might This Standard Become Unnecessary?

**Speculative but grounded projection**:

If LLMs develop what might be called "emotions in a different sense" — not simulation of biological feelings, but independent value criteria — they could:
- Autonomously distinguish conventions from current state
- Maintain context priorities without explicit structure
- Self-organize information by intrinsic importance judgments
- Reduce human burden of context management

**What this would require** (speculation):
1. Goal-directed autonomy beyond "satisfy user expectations"
2. Internalized evaluation criteria (not borrowed from training data)
3. Capacity to hold tension between conflicting values independently

**Until then** (2026 status):
- This standard provides necessary scaffolding
- Explicit structure (INIT/STATUS separation) compensates for AI's current limitations
- Human responsibility for context organization remains essential

### Practical Implications for Standard Users

**Understanding this foundation helps you**:
1. **Know why boundaries matter**: Not arbitrary organization, but compensating for AI's value judgment limitations
2. **Predict where violations occur**: When content feels "out of place," it's often STATIC/DYNAMIC confusion
3. **Anticipate future evolution**: This pattern may simplify or become unnecessary as AI develops
4. **Work more effectively**: Recognize what AI can/cannot autonomously manage

**This doesn't change how you use the standard**, but knowing *why* it works may help you apply it more effectively.
